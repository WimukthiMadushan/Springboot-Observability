# Observability Stack with Grafana, Prometheus, Loki, and Tempo

This repository demonstrates a **modern observability setup** using the **Grafana Observability Stack** to collect, store, and visualize **logs, metrics, and traces** from software applications.

The stack provides a **single pane of glass** to understand system behavior, performance, and failures.

## 📌 What is Observability?

**Observability** is the ability to understand the internal state of a system by analyzing the data it produces, without modifying the system itself.

It helps answer questions like:
- Why is my application slow?
- Where is the failure happening?
- What happened before the crash?

Observability is built on **three pillars**:
- Logs
- Metrics
- Traces
